This might be the breakthrough paper of the year. A group of astrophysicists have found convincing evidence that the Nobel Prize for dark energy was awarded in error. The expansion of the universe might not be accelerating, as we've been told, and that might just entirely change our understanding of the universe. Let's have a look.

The physics Nobel Prize of 2011 went to Saul Perlmutter, Brian Schmidt, and Adam Riess for the discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, based on observations of distant type 1A supernovae. This expansion can't be caused by any normal type of matter or energy, so astrophysicists have attributed it to a mysterious type of dark energy.

The Nobel Prize-winning observation heavily relied on regularities of this type of supernovae. They assumed that these stellar explosions always happen in a very similar way, no matter what galaxy the supernova is in. Astrophysicists like to refer to them as "standard candles". The new paper, which just appeared, says that, well, that just isn't so.

They looked at the new collections of data of supernovae from two different experiments. Together, these are more than 3,000. This is much more data than Perlmutter, Schmidt, and Riess had in the 1990s when they did their analysis. Back then, they had fewer than 100.

The authors of the new paper split the data apart into groups by two different criteria. The first is how far the light traveled from the galaxy to us. This is the same as the Nobel Prize winners used. The further the supernova, the dimmer it appears. And since the universe expands, the wavelength of the light gets stretched as it travels. This is called the redshift. It's the relation between the dimming and the redshift that tells us how the universe expands.

The new thing is that they also looked at how old the galaxy was when the supernova happened. This is a different type of information. Basically, the overall light emission from the entire galaxy has a different spectral shape depending on how old the galaxy is. The kicker is that they find these different properties are correlated. The younger the galaxy, the dimmer the supernovae, independent of the redshift.

The problem is now that, naturally, the further back in time you look, the younger the average galaxy. But since the age is correlated with the supernova properties, this looks exactly like the key evidence for the accelerated expansion of the universe. Basically, they say that it's wrong to conclude that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. It's just that younger galaxies have on average dimmer supernovae. They don't say why this might be the case. They simply state this is what the data really say.

And this isn't one of those maybe-results with loose statistical significance. This is a whopping 5.56 sigma correlation, which they call a "serious systematic bias". They also redid the calculation for the expansion of the universe and find that it currently isn't accelerating. It's actually slightly decelerating, though it seems to have accelerated in the past. If it goes on to decelerate, then this might mean the universe will eventually collapse.

And yes, this finding is neatly compatible with other recent results from DESY and the Dark Energy Survey. They also found that it looks like this somewhat alleviates the Hubble tension, though it doesn't make it go away.

The paper has been peer-reviewed and it's published in a decent journal. But, this correlation in the data isn't entirely new. And its relevance has been debated among astrophysicists for a couple of years now. Most believe that the effect is there, but much smaller than what this group says. That's why I give this paper a six out of ten on the bullshit meter. It seems likely that soon enough another group will question these findings.

What does it mean if this is correct? Well, for one thing, it means that the 2011 Nobel Prize in physics was given out in error. The data analysis from Perlmutter, Schmidt, and Riess has been questioned previously for various reasons. These criticisms have all come down to the fact that it was a very small set of data and it simply couldn't support the conclusion in a solid way.

Back then, it spoke a lot in their favor that there were two independent groups coming to the same conclusions. Although, it doesn't take much digging to see that these groups were far from independent. In fact, the papers from the two groups have one author in common and the rest of the team explicitly acknowledges help from the Perlmutter team.

It also means, hopefully, that physicists will finally revise the standard model for our universe. In the past decade, evidence has been mounting that something is seriously wrong with it. This finding might be the final straw. So the standard candles aren't as standard as we thought they were.
